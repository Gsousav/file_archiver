```

## Pro Tips

### 1. Test First with Dry-Run

Always review the dry-run before confirming. It shows:
- What files will be moved
- Where they'll go
- Any duplicates or collisions
- Potential errors

### 2. Keep Multiple Sessions

Each run creates a timestamped session folder. This means:
- Easy rollback if needed
- Historical record of what was organized
- No risk of mixing up different archiving runs

### 3. Customize Categories

Edit `core/config.py` to add your own categories:

```python
CATEGORIES = {
    "work_docs": ["docx", "xlsx", "pptx"],
    "personal_photos": ["jpg", "png", "heic"],
    # ... add your own
}
```

### 4. Handle Duplicates

The program detects duplicates automatically using file hashing. Review the warnings to decide which copies to keep.

### 5. View the HTML Report

Open `archive_report.html` in your browser for:
- Visual overview of what was archived
- File lists by category
- Duplicate detection results
- Any errors or warnings

## Common Use Cases

### Cleaning Downloads Folder

```bash
$ python -m file_archiver
Directories: ~/Downloads
Selection: 1
Proceed? yes
```

### Organizing Multiple Folders

```bash
$ python -m file_archiver
Directories: ~/Downloads, ~/Desktop, ~/Documents/Temp
Selection: all
Proceed? yes
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from file_archiver import DirectoryScanner, FileClassifier, FileMover

scanner = DirectoryScanner()
classifier = FileClassifier()
mover = FileMover()

# Your custom logic here
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Errors

If you see permission errors:
```bash
# Make sure you have read/write access to directories
chmod -R u+rw ~/Downloads
```

### No Recommendations

If no directories are recommended:
- They might have fewer than 10 files
- Try scanning different directories
- Adjust `MIN_FILES_FOR_RECOMMENDATION` in `core/config.py`

### Missing Dependencies

```bash
# Install all optional dependencies
pip install -e ".[full]"
```
